    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Large or small, these triple chocolate cookies are crispy on <br>
        the outside and chewy on the inside. Refrigerating the batter <br>
        for 48 hours before baking is ideal, as this allows the dough <br>
        to fully form its flavor.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a <br>
            large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, <br>
            deep brown mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until <br>
            mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add <br>
            slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, <br>
            but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk <br>
            chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate using a <br>
            spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and refrigerate <br>
            for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when <br>
            ready to bake.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on <br>
            a cookie sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look <br>
            golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; <br>
            the centers will not look fully done. Cool until cookies <br>
            are set, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
