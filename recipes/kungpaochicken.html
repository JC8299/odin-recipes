    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This spicy kung pao chicken is similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. <br>
        It's easy to make, and you can be as creative with the measurements as you want. <br>
        The sauce reduces until nice and thick. Substitute cashews for peanuts, or bamboo <br>
        shoots for the water chestnuts. You can't go wrong! Enjoy!
